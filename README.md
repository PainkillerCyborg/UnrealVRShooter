# VR Shooter prototype made in Unreal Engine and currently building to test on Google Cardboard VR.

Currently the prototype only has these features:
1) A First Person character which can fire rigid body spheres with left click.
2) The spheres die after a few seconds to save memory.
3) Randomly generating cubes all around the character. These cubes will later be used as targets to hit with your spheres.
4) The game can run on a Google Cardboard with a good performing device and with the help of a gamepad, the spheres can be fired.

I am working on the following features for the prototype(presently on hold for completing another important project):
1) Fire using cardboard clicker, that comes in a lot of cardboards.
2) UI for timer, points and ammo.
3) Scoring on hitting cubes.
4) Beautify with good graphics and models rather than simple shapes in UI as well as gameplay.

Anyone who's interested in joining, is welcome! :)
